    Convert pressures from pascals into log units. Log units are defined in such a way that a realistic range of
     pressures (for that vacuum element) goes from 0 to 100. The advantage of the log units is simplicity and high
     sensitivity for the good vacuum values (where it matters) and low sensitivity for poor vacuum values (where it
     doesn't).
