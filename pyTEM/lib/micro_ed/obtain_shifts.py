    Automatically obtain the image shifts required to compensate for lateral specimen movement introduced by tilting.
    The returned shifts can then be used to keep the currently centered section of the specimen centered during a
     tilt acquisition series.

    Calibration images are taken while stationary at the tilt values listed in alphas. We don't take these images
     while tilting because, depending on the ratio of tilt range to exposure time, this may result in very blurry
     images.

    This function does not compensate for things like backlash and gear hysteresis. # TODO: Compensate for them

    Image shifts are estimated using Hyperspy's estimate_shift2D() function. This function uses a phase correlation
     algorithm based on the following paper:
        Schaffer, Bernhard, Werner Grogger, and Gerald Kothleitner. “Automated Spatial Drift Correction for EFTEM
        Image Series.” Ultramicroscopy 102, no. 1 (December 2004): 27–36.

    :param microscope: pyTEM.Interface:
        A pyTEM interface to the microscope.
    :param alphas: np.array:
        An array of tilt angles at which to compute shifts.
    :param camera_name: str:
        The name of the camera to be used in the image shift calculation - probably want to use the same camera you are
         using for the tilt series itself.
    :param sampling: str:
        One of:
            - '4k' for 4k images (4096 x 4096; sampling=1)
            - '2k' for 2k images (2048 x 2048; sampling=2)
            - '1k' for 1k images (1024 x 1024; sampling=3)
            - '0.5k' for 05.k images (512 x 512; sampling=8)

    :param exposure_time: float: (optional; default is 0.25)
        The exposure time, in seconds, to use for the shift calibration images.
        This should be as small as possible to limit the dose the sample receives.
    :param batch_wise: bool (optional; default is False):
        Compute image shifts in batches, readjusting the image shift after each batch. Limiting the number of images
         per batch can help make sure the image doesn't change too much, and also helps limit our RAM usage. One of:
            - True: Compute image shifts batch-wise.
            - False: Compute all image shifts in one go.
        Computing image shifts batch-wise requires a change in tilt direction. This might introduce additional error.
     :param verbose: bool (optional; default is False):
        Print out extra information. Useful for debugging.

    :return: np.array: shifts:
        An array of tuples of the form (x, y) where x and y are the required image shifts (in microns) required to
