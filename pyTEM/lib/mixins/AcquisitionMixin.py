            An array of tuples of the form (x, y) where x and y are the image shifts (in microns) to apply for the
             corresponding acquisition. If None, no image shifts will be applied.
            If provided, len(shifts) must equal num.
            While there are other applications, image shifts can be used to compensation for lateral image shift while
             tilting or moving.
        :param alphas: np.array of floats (optional; default is None):
            An array of alpha tilt angles at which to perform the acquisitions. These are angles we tilt to and then
             stop and acquire. If you want to acquire and tilt simultaneously, please use tilt_bounds.

        This function provides the following optional controls by means of multitasking. Utilizing either of these
         functionalities results in the spawning of a separate parallel process to handle it.
        # TODO: Eliminate the additional runtime caused by process creation and interface creation (maybe by switching
            to threading, or perhaps creating the parallel process right when the user first connects to the microscope
            and grabbing barriers from a Manager).
            Illumination controls (including beam blanker controls) can only be called from the thread in which they
            were marshalled, so right now we just perform all multitasking with a separate process. Maybe could use
            pythoncom.CoMarshalInterThreadInterfaceInStream() to sort the issue.

        :param blanker_optimization: bool (optional; default is True):
            When we call the core Thermo Fisher acquisition command, the camera is blind for
             one interval of exposure_time and then records for the next interval of exposure_time. Therefore, the full
             acquisition takes 2 * exposure_time + some communication delays. In order to minimize sample exposure
             (material are often beam sensitive), we can opt to control the blanker in a parallel process where we
             only unblank when the camera is actually recording.
            One of:
                True: Minimize dose by means of blanking while the camera is not actually recording. The beam is only
                 unblanked for exposure_time + 0.05 seconds for each image.
                False: Proceed without optimized blanker control, the beam will be unblanked for the full
                        2 * exposure_time + some communication delays.

        :param tilt_bounds: array of float (optional; default is None):
            An array of alpha start-stop values for the tilt acquisition(s), in degrees.
            len(tilt_bounds) should equal num + 1
            Doesn't need to be evenly spaced, the tilt speed will adapt for each individual acquisition.
            This method takes care of ensuring we are at the starting angle (tilt_bounds[0]) before performing the
             first acquisition.
            Notice that when tilting, exposure time is really more of an integration time.
            Upon return the stage is left at the final destination -> tilt_bounds[-1].
            If None, or an array of length 0, then no tilting is performed. One of alphas and tilt_bounds must be None.
