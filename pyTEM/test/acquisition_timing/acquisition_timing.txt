Time between overall acquisition start and core start:
0.03007984161376953
0.024063825607299805   (3s acq)
0.02306079864501953    (6s acq)
0.023056983947753906    (0.5s acq)

Time between overall acquisition core and overall acquisition end (here is where you build the acq object and such): 
0.2667090892791748
0.2737274169921875		(3s acq)
0.2777383327484131    (6s acq)
0.2185811996459961   (0.5s acq)


Conclusions:
Time required to complete the whole acquisition is:  2 * exposure_time + 0.94, most of this extra time is from after the core acquisition

Time required to complete the core acquisition is:  2 * exposure_time + 0.66
Assume half of this 0.66 hapens before and half after, no way to tell.

Once we call acquisition(), we should wait (0.025 + 0.33 + exposure_time) before we start tilting.
