This is BASF's in-house TEM scripting interface. Bolted directly on top of a COM interface, this is just a Python
 wrapper for the scripting interface of Thermo Fisher Scientific and FEI microscopes.

This is not a complete interface in that it does not provide access to all the functionality of the underlying Thermo
 Fisher Scientific and FEI scripting interface. However, it provides access to all basic microscope functions as well
 as all those required by other pyTEM automation scripts.

    An interface for the Thermo-Fisher TEM microscopes.

    This is basically just a "user-friendly" wrapper for the Thermo-Fisher 'Instrument' object that is used to
     actually interact with and control the microscope. Note that there is a COM interface (a middle man of sorts)
     facilitating communication between the "user-friendly" wrapper and the underlying Thermo-Fisher 'Instrument'
     object.

    Note when adding mixins that those which include other mixins must be listed before those which they include.

    Public Attributes:
        None.

    Protected Attributes:
        _tem: Thermo Fisher 'Instrument' object:
            This is used "under-the-hood" to actually interact with and control a subset the microscope's features
        _tem_advanced: Thermo Fisher 'AdvancedInstrument' object
            This is used "under-the-hood" to actually interact with and control a remainder of the microscope's
             features.
        _stage_position: An instance of the simplified, forward facing StagePosition class:
            The current stage position.
        _image_shift_matrix: 2D numpy.ndarray:
            Matrix used to translate between the stage-plane and the image-plane.
            This matrix is based on a manual calibration, it is not perfect, but it does a reasonable job.
        _beam_shift_matrix: 2D numpy.ndarray:
            Matrix used to translate between the stage-plane and the beam-plane.
            This matrix is based on the image shift matrix.

    Private Attributes:
        None.  Note: pyTEM attributes required by another mixin cannot be made private otherwise the mixins
                        will not be able to access them through the COM interface.
